# Object Detection in Real-Time Systems using Convolutional Neural Networks with Deep Learning
A CNN inspired by the idea of hyperparameters from AlexNet and the concept of depth as an important aspect from VGGNet designed to identify objects in video feed. It can be used for surveillance purposes in indoor surveillance area, like a parking lot, or a bank office or an outdoor location, like a protected forest area, or a state highway,to detect any unwanted and malicious activities and alert the personnel thereby reducing the effort and cost required to constantly monitor footage.
